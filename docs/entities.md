# Entities

## Enabled By Default

Core entities focus on data and controls that come directly from the local battery connection:

- System Average Battery SOC
- Battery 1 SOC, Battery 2 SOC, and further generic battery slots when exposed by the master
- PV, AC charge, battery charge, battery discharge, grid, backup, and battery power
- Energy charged, discharged, and generated
- Operating Mode
- Charge Power Target and Discharge Power Target
- PV Surplus Charge Trigger
- Charge Limit and Discharge Limit
- Overnight Charge, Manual SOC, Off-Peak Tariff, Off-Peak Start, and Off-Peak End
- Solar Availability
- Overnight Status and Recommended Overnight SOC
- House Demand Energy and House Demand Daily
- Battery Status
- Connection Status
- Wi-Fi Loss Recovery (configuration switch; off by default)
- Cosy Automated Control and Cosy Daylight Flex (configuration switches; off by default)

Charge Power can be selected from `200 W` to `1200 W` per unit in `100 W`
steps. New installations start at `800 W`. Discharge Power remains limited to
`800 W`–`1200 W` per unit.

Individual Battery N SOC entities are created from local `Storage_list` entries
reported by the master. Restart Home Assistant or reload the integration after
adding or replacing a battery/inverter so new entity slots are created. Removed
higher-numbered slots are cleaned up only after the master has reported the same
smaller topology for several consecutive successful polls.

`Operating Mode` is the last mode commanded through this local
integration. If the AEC Cloud app changes the system, the selector may not
reflect that external action. Use Battery Status, power sensors, Last Command
Result, and control-register snapshots when comparing local behaviour with app
or cloud-originated changes.

`PV Surplus Charge Trigger` is useful when the AFERIY system shares the same
electrical system with an unmanaged micro-inverter or another PV source that it
does not directly control. When your Smart Meter (usually Shelly) sees export rise above the chosen `0 W` to `50 W`
threshold, the batteries ramp up and start charging from the extra energy. A
small buffer helps avoid hunting or "chattering" around zero export.

## Diagnostic Entities

Diagnostic entities are intended for troubleshooting rather than dashboards:

- Consecutive Poll Failures
- Last Command Result
- Firmware Version
- Selected raw or derived diagnostic readings

## Energy Estimate Sensors

- Battery Capacity, selected in 1.958 kWh module steps
- Estimated House Demand
- Recommended Overnight SOC

Estimated House Demand includes the AFERIY PV reading plus any additional live
solar power entities configured under the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard's
Solar Panels section. The integration excludes its own AFERIY PV entity to
prevent double-counting. The sensor attributes list the additional entities and
wattage included in the calculation.

Battery Capacity is used by energy and overnight charge calculations only. It
does not control individual Battery N SOC entity creation.

### Recommended Overnight SOC

Recommended Overnight SOC is designed for homes with a cheap overnight tariff, for example Octopus Go. It suggests the battery target to charge to overnight, so the battery has enough energy for the morning without always charging to 100%.

The calculation can use:

- The configured usable battery capacity
- A weighted 30-day household energy-use profile from Home Assistant history,
  prioritising the latest 14 valid occupied days and using older days as lighter
  holiday-resistant fallback history. Home Assistant Recorder should retain at
  least 35 days.
- Solar forecast data, ideally from Solcast
- The expected Pre-Sunrise Need before solar generation is useful
- The expected Post-Sunset Need after useful solar falls away and before off-peak starts
- Home occupancy from `zone.home`, so empty-house days can be treated separately from normal household demand
- Battery discharge and grid charge efficiency allowances
- A protected Overnight Safety Buffer, plus automatic safeguards that increase
  when forecast or demand history is less certain

Pre-Sunrise Need is the estimated energy needed after the cheap-rate window ends and before sustained forecast solar should cover house demand. Weak early-morning forecast solar is only given partial credit until sustained useful solar is expected. If the forecast never reaches sustained useful solar, part of the day forecast is still credited so low winter solar can reduce the target instead of forcing 100%. If Solar Availability is set to Solar Unavailable, the calculation treats forecast solar as 0 kWh and reports Batteries Only. The recommended target percentage is calculated from that kWh need, the configured battery capacity, the wider peak-rate window, recent use, expected solar, efficiency losses, automatic safeguards, and a confidence adjustment. It is then kept within practical SOC limits.

`Overnight Safety Buffer` is protected SOC headroom above the battery reserve at
the point useful solar is expected to take over. With a `10%` reserve and a `3%`
buffer, the modeled handover floor is therefore `13%`. Learned morning demand,
including recurring air-conditioning use, is the energy expected to be consumed
before that handover; it does not replace the safety buffer. Negative adaptive
corrections may reduce the predicted-demand component, but cannot consume the
configured buffer. Forecast-confidence and stale-data safeguards remain
separate.

Useful attributes include `target_breakdown_summary`, `recommendation_reason`, `pre_sunrise_need_kwh`, `post_sunset_need_kwh`, `whole_day_net_shortfall_kwh`, `pre_sunrise_net_need_kwh`, `pre_sunrise_credited_solar_kwh`, `no_useful_solar_forecast`, `solar_credit_mode`, `solar_unavailable_override`, `solar_override_status`, `solar_break_even_at`, `recorder_history_weighting`, `recorder_history_daily_averages`, `forecast_confidence`, `stale_data_guard_active`, `dynamic_buffer_soc`, `battery_loss_allowance_kwh`, `estimated_grid_charge_energy_to_target_kwh`, and `target_jump_guard`.

For best results, configure the battery capacity correctly, keep Home Assistant recorder history available, and provide Solcast forecast sensors. Without enough data the sensor may use conservative defaults or show that it cannot calculate a reliable target.

### Solcast Setup Note

When setting up Solcast, **do not set the AC inverter output to 800 W per unit**.

The batteries are capable of charging much faster than this and are rated to
**2.4 kW**.

If this is set too low, Solcast can under-estimate solar production. That can
make the overnight recommendation too high and charge the batteries more than
needed.

## Local Overnight Scheduling

AFERIY/AEC Cloud app schedule captures showed a cloud-side schedule object, but
direct local writes of the mirrored schedule-slot registers behaved as immediate
commands on the PS240. The integration therefore performs the timing in Home
Assistant and uses the proven local controls:

- Start local Charge one minute after the configured off-peak start time.
- Use System Average Battery SOC as the target feedback.
- Leave the confirmed charge-to-target command latched so the battery BMS can
  hold the target without repeated Charge/Idle switching.
- Restore Self-Gen/Zero Export five minutes before the off-peak end time.

This avoids relying on the cloud scheduler and keeps the local integration's
control path predictable.

## External Helpers

The options page includes confirmation checkboxes for common external helpers:

- Solcast PV Forecast, for timed solar forecast data
- Home occupancy through `zone.home`, for empty-house demand handling

These checkboxes are installer reminders. They do not install integrations or block setup.

## Wi-Fi Loss Recovery

`Wi-Fi Loss Recovery` is an opt-in configuration switch for a compatible local
Linksys router. Enabling it first validates the router identity, WirelessAP4
capability, administrator password, and current 2.4 GHz channel without changing
settings. After the battery becomes unavailable following six consecutive poll
failures, the `Wi-Fi Recovery Grace Period` number waits 0–60 minutes before one
verified channel 6/11 toggle. Valid battery telemetry during this grace period
cancels the pending change. Entity attributes expose status, reason,
current/requested channel, grace deadline, poll count, last result, and cooldown
timing, but never the router address, administrator password, SSID, or Wi-Fi
passphrase.
